## Hello GitHub visitor! <3

My name is Jesper and I am from Sweden. I don't work in IT but have for the longest time had a thing for computers. So eventhough my coding abilities might be close to non-exsistent, I love to learn new things, which is what I keep on my GitHub.

I have two Raspberry Pis where I host some docker containers on, and Docker is my prefered way of running services!
